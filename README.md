# UFO

1.	Overview of the analysis:
This analysis project will provide a website that contains tables with UFO data sightings. 
The coding analysis was written in JavaScript and the code for the webpage was written in HTML. Pictures demonstrating how to use the webpage will be included.



2.	Results:
The homepage is shown below.

It will display all the UFO sightings. You will need to look over all of the data in order to select the location you want to search.

On the left side of the webpage you will see:
Filter Search, Enter Date, Enter a City, Enter a State, Enter a Country, Enter a Shape.

Please keep in mind that the text format has to be copied exactly as shown on the webpage. The filter search is case sensitive. 
For example: if you want a successful search result for 
“park city ky us light” you have to type the syntax exactly as shown.

If you capitalize any letter you will have a failed search result as the following picture shows.

3.	Summary:
One major issue with the search function box is that if you capitalize any letter you will have a failed search result. 

Further development recommendations.
1.	Adding a clickable search button will make the webpage more user friendly.
2.	 Visually showing the locations of these phenomenon would add some pizzazz to the webpage.
